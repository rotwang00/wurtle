Wurtle - A Wordle Clone
=======================

Problem
-------
Create a clone of the game Wordle. 

Rules:
The computer randomly and secretly chooses a 5-letter word.
The player inputs a guess word.
After each guess, the computer gives feedback.
  Any letter that is in the correct spot has a green background.
  Any letter that is present in the word, but not in the correct spot, has a yellow background.
  All other letters have a grey background.
If the word is guessed within 6 tries, the player wins.
If the word is not guessed within 6 tries, the player loses.

There is a seperate display of all the letters of the alphabet.
This keeps track of guessed letters, as an aid for the player.
Each letter begins with a white background.
After each guess, the display is updated.
  Any letter that was guessed in the correct spot has a green background.
  Any letter that is present in the word, but not in the correct spot, has a yellow background.
  All other guessed letters have a grey background.
