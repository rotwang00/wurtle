Wurtle - A Wordle Clone
=======================

Problem
-------
Create a clone of the game Wordle. 

Rules:
The computer randomly and secretly chooses a 5-letter word.
The player inputs a 5-letter guess word.
The guess must be a real word.
After each guess, the computer gives feedback.
  Any letter that is in the correct spot has a green background.
  Any letter that is present in the word, but not in the correct spot, has a yellow background.
  All other letters have a grey background.
  In the case of duplicate letters, green takes precedence over yellow.
If the word is guessed within 6 tries, the player wins.
If the word is not guessed within 6 tries, the player loses.

There is a seperate display of all the letters of the alphabet.
This keeps track of guessed letters, as an aid for the player.
Each letter begins with a white background.
After each guess, the display is updated.
  Any letter that was guessed in the correct spot has a green background.
  Any letter that is present in the word, but not in the correct spot, has a yellow background.
  All other guessed letters have a grey background.
  

Examples
--------
Secret word: PIANO
Guess: CRANE
Result: A and N would be colored green. C, R, and E would be colored grey.
Guess: PLANE
Result: P, A, and N would be colored green. L and E would be colored grey.
Guess: PIANO
Result: All letters would be colored green. The player would win.

If a letter appears more than once in the secret word, no special information is given to the player when that letter is guessed.
If the player guesses a word with a duplicate letter, and that letter appears only once in the secret word, only one of the guessed letters changes color.


Data Structures
---------------
The secret word will be an array of chars.
Each guess word will be an array of chars.
